			<h2>Chinese Character inpainting (April 4, 2022) </h2>

			<p>This is my video submission for an assignment given in CMPT461 (Computational Photography and Image Manipulation). The assignment was to make a video regarding a published paper. I have chosen this paper in particular because it I find quite interesting. The paper can be accessed through this link: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3474085.3475333">Link to Paper</a>.</p>
			<h3>My Thought Process</h3>
			<p>During the first few weeks of the lecture, the instructor told us that we will be making videos regarding published papers. The instructor told us about what resources we could use to prepare ourselves before the assignment was given. One of the thing that stands out to me was Adobe Premiere Pro. To give some context, I have made YouTube videos already so I'm a bit experienced in editing video. However, as of that moment, I have never use Adobe Premiere Pro (I have been using iMovie). From that moment onwards, I have begun practicing editing video using Adobe Premiere Pro by making YouTube videos about video games. It was also during that time that my friend helped me create my Avatar that I use in almost all videos now (and even this website!). After practicing with Adobe Premiere Pro for 2 months, it was finally time to create the video for my assignment.</p>
			<p>I have chosen the paper about Chinese Character Inpainting and the instructor approved it. This meant that I could finally start on making my video. This assignment was a bit weird. Normally, assignment like this usually have some sort of rubric that we could follow to make sure that we're making videos up to the standards of the instructor. However, for this assignment, all the instructor told us was to create a video discussing one of the topics taught in class. There doesn't seem to be any restriction whatsoever so I decided to do what most students would not do... use an avatar in my video. This avatar is what I'm trying to make people recognize to be my brand so I decided to use it. It was a bit risky because the outcome of it is either the instructor hate it or the instructor will enjoy it, with no inbetween whatsoever. Still, I decided to proceed anyway because I thought it would be interesting and fun.</p>
			<p> I could technically do what I normally do with my YouTube video and be done with it. However, I wanted to try out new things and experiment, which resulted in this video. Here are the list of things I tried out during the making of this video:</p>

			<dt> <strong>Animation</strong> </dt>
			<dd> I watched a lot of YouTube during my free time and because of that, I am aware of the quality difference between my videos and the popular ones on YouTube. Even so, everyone has to start somewhere. That is why I tried lots of new things that I have seen a lot in other YouTube videos. One of them was animation. This was my first time creating something like this so I had to look at some tutorials. Most animation tutorials use Adobe After Effects so I ended up learning about it too. I watched a tutorial explaining how to do a fluid gradient animation. I ended up basically copying the tutorial while adding some changes to suit my taste. This resulted in the animation in Figure 1. This was also my very first video I tried to do some text animation using keyframing in Adobe Premier Pro. This can also be seen in Figure 1 and throughout the video. There are actually a lot of different kinds of animation that I tried out in this video. However, due to the sheer amount of quantity of small animations I did, I will only be acknowledging them here. I will just say that after doing around 5 different animations in Adobe Premier Pro, I managed to get comfortable enough to make any animations I want using keyframe. I am really proud of the result even if the animations I made are very minor and not a lot of people will appreciate it.</dd><br>

			<dt> <strong>Sound Effects (SFX)</strong> </dt>
			<dd> A good video without sound effects is like eating leftovers. It is still good but a bit bland. Which is why for the first time ever, I tried adding sound effects to my video. Since I'm not a music composer (yet), I am still unexperienced with recording sounds and music. This is why I searched online instead for royalty-free sound effects. It is slightly more difficult to find the right SFX because most of the SFX I envisioned are behind a paywall. This meant that my selection becomes a bit more limited but I think I managed to get some pretty good SFX. Timing the SFX in time with the animation took a bit of getting used to but I think it came out pretty great.</dd><br>

			<h3> My Final Thoughts on the Video</h3>
			<p> I am very proud of how this video came out. Not only is making this video fun and enjoyable to make, it is also probably my highest quality video I have ever made. Even though I am writing about this after a few months have passed, it is still one of my proudest video I have ever made. If you haven't already, please give my video a watch and leave a comment in that video to let me know what you think. I will always seek to improve my video so any comment would be appreciated. I'm currently trying to get a computer since the laptop I used to edit this video can't handle rendering highly edited video so I won't be posting any new video soon until I got that sorted out. Thanks for reading this far and look forward for more upcoming posts!</p>
