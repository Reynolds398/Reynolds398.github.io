			<h2>Chinese Character inpainting (April 4, 2022) </h2>

			<p>This is my video submission for an assignment given in CMPT461 (Computational Photography and Image Manipulation). The assignment was to make a video regarding a published paper. I have chosen this paper in particular because it I find quite interesting. The paper can be accessed through this link: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3474085.3475333">Link to Paper</a>.</p>
			<h3>My Thought Process</h3>
			<p>During the first few weeks of the lecture, the instructor told us that we will be making videos regarding published papers. The instructor told us about what resources we could use to prepare ourselves before the assignment was given. One of the thing that stands out to me was Adobe Premiere Pro. To give some context, I have made YouTube videos already so I'm a bit experienced in editing video. However, as of that moment, I have never use Adobe Premiere Pro (I have been using iMovie). From that moment onwards, I have begun practicing editing video using Adobe Premiere Pro by making YouTube videos about video games. It was also during that time that my friend helped me create my Avatar that I use in almost all videos now. After practicing with Adobe Premiere Pro for 2 months, it was finally time to create the video for my assignment.</p>
			<p>I have chosen the paper about Chinese Character Inpainting and the instructor approved it. This meant that I could finally start on making my video. This assignment was a bit weird. Normally, assignment like this usually have some sort of rubric that we could follow to make sure that we're making videos up to the standards of the instructor. However, for this assignment, all the instructor told us was to create a video discussing one of the topics taught in class. There doesn't seem to be any restriction whatsoever so I decided to do what most students would not do... use an avatar in my video. This avatar is what I'm trying to make people recognize to be my brand so I decided to use it. It was a bit risky because the outcome of it is either the instructor hate it or the instructor will enjoy it, with no inbetween whatsoever. Still, I decided to proceed anyway because I thought it would be interesting and fun.</p>
			<p> I could technically do what I normally do with my YouTube video and be done with it. However, I wanted to try out new things and experiment, which resulted in this video. Here are the list of things I tried out during the making of this video:</p>

			<dt> <strong>Animation</strong> </dt>
			<dd> I watched a lot of YouTube during my free time and because of that, I am aware of the quality difference between my videos and the popular ones in YouTube. Even so, everyone have to start somewhere so I tried some things out. One of them was animation. This was my first time creating something like this so I had to look at some tutorials. Most animation tutorials all use Adobe After Effects so I ended up learning about it too. I watched a tutorial explaining how to do a fluid gradient animation. I ended up basically copying the tutorial while adding some changes to suit my taste. This resulted in the animation in Figure 1.</dd><br>
