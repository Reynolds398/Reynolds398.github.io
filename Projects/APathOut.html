			<h2>A Path Out (June 13, 2021)</h2>

				<p id="firstp">A Path Out was the very first game that I ever worked on. The game idea was that the player will take control of a conjoined twin that has the ability to separate and connect back together. It was suppose to be some sort of platformer game with some elements of puzzle to keep it interesting. The unique aspect of this game was the fact that to control the character, the player would have to use the "A" key to move left and right arrow key to move right. This is to emphasize that they are different characters and not just one character. The goal for this prototype was to create at least 3 small levels. Unfortunately, we failed to reach this goal due to a lot of unforseen problems.</p>
				<p>I was the director for this project. However, this was my first time doing something like this. This resulted in a lot of issues in the workflow of the game. Not only that, this was also the first time I made a game so I had to figure out a lot of things while working on this game. Unfortunately, both me and my friend who helped me with coding the project is not that experienced with Unity so we had to spend a lot of time just watching tutorials. In the end, we only managed to implement very few things and no gameplay element whatsoever. Even with my lack of experience and very short time limit, I still managed to accomplish something. The result was not what I expected but I'm pretty proud of what I managed to accomplish for our very first game. Here's the list of mechanics that I implemented in the game:</p> <br><br><br>

				</div>
				<dt> <strong>Animation</strong> </dt>
				<dd> Animation is a very important aspect in any game. However, I never realized how complicated it could be. I thought simply adding the correct sprite would make everything work properly but I was clearly wrong. After watching some tutorials, I sort of figured out how it works. I managed to make the character to switch between different animations correctly. I created some booleans to figure out the state of the player at all times and to play the corresponding animation based on that state. Although, there are some issues with the jump animation as can be seen in Figure 2. Other than that, it looks pretty good. There are a couple animation issues due to extreme cases (one such case is jumping first before moving) but I decided to leave it be since I still have to work on the mechanics of the game.</dd><br>

				<dt> <strong>Enemy AI</strong> </dt>
				<dd> The initial plan was to introduce a couple of enemies to provide some sort of challenge for the player. However, we couldn't really implement anything else besides the enemy pathing. I came up with this pathing myself and it is very simple too. To put it simply, I made it so that the code will figure out where the enemy is located in the world and make it move left and right. I essentially make the enemy always move to the right using this line of code "transform.Translate(Vector2.left * speed * Time.deltaTime * phaseDirection)". This code essentially means "move left" * phaseDirection. After reaching a certain distance, it will flip the enemy sprite and make phaseDirection to be negative. This essentially made the code from before become "move right". This resulted in the enemy to behave like in Figure 4.</dd><br>

			<h2>Problems I faced during the project</h2>
			<p> It can't be said enough that this whole project is full of problems. To give some context, I had only learned Unity for around 2 months before joining this Game Jam. I have never attempted to make any original game before. Even though I was clearly lacking in experience, I thought that I should probably participate anyway in order to gain more experience. Immediately after starting the project, I realized that just figuring out how to make the player jump is not as simple as I thought. I had to watch some tutorials to get the right feeling for the jump. Thankfully, I managed to get the jump to work but I spend way more time on it than I should have.</p>
			<p> Once that was done, I was immediately greeted with another problem. I didn't know what to do afterwards since the art assets was not done yet so I couldn't create the level. I ended up simply waiting for the asset to be completed so I could start creating the level. After a few hours, I realized my mistake. I should've just use some primitive objects to act as a stand-in for the assets so I could actually continue working on the mechanics of the game. So I started to search for tutorials regarding how to set up sound effects, creating buttons, and try to figure out how to separate the characters and combine them again. I managed to get the sound effects to work but it was way too loud. Not only that, the sound effect volume was constant regardless of whether you are close to the source or not. I didn't end up fixing this problem. I tried to create some doors that require the player to interact with a button to open but I couldn't get it to work. This is because I was still confused regarding how collision interaction work in Unity and unfortunately I couldn't understand it before the submission deadline.</p>
			<p> Afterwards, the art team had finally managed to complete the assets. I immediately noticed a problem with it since the background assets have the objects assets merged with it. What this means is that I couldn't move around the objects to create different levels with the same assets. This is why I ended up making just one level. Not only that, the sprite sheet that was made for the main character was not centered so I had to make the art team modify it until they got it right. This happened because my whole team are completely new when it comes to making games. Once the art team got it right, I went on and try to make the animation transitions work. I had to watch countless tutorials and spent way too many hours just trying to make it work. Implementing the animation is as complicated as how it looks in Figure 5. This is why there is barely any gameplay element in our game.</p>

			<p> This project was a complete failure in terms of delivering an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). However, I managed to learn a lot from this experience regarding creating a game. From the time I'm writing this, I have spent a lot more time learning more about Unity to the point where I can say that I can implement anything as long as I am given sufficient amount of time. I also made sure to not repeat the same mistake regarding the art assets for our next GMTK Game Jam. Even though it was a complete failure, I am glad that I participated in this Game Jam. I also want to thank my friends for helping out on this project.</p>
