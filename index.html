		<h2>What is this website about?</h2>
		<p>This website is essentially where I showcase all of the projects and other works I have done. It is technically my portfolio. However, I wanted to also use this website to log everything I have done in terms of making videos, art, music and programming projects so I can look back and see the progress I've made. Feel free to browse through and look at what I have done so far!

		<h2>My latest project: Dice Maker</h2>
		<a>pic here</a>
		<p>Dice Maker is my most latest project that I worked on. This is a personal project that I did for the GMTK Game Jam 2022. This is the best prototype I have ever made (probably because the other prototype I made for the GMTK Game Jam 2021 was incomplete). This project is very interesting to say the least. I have never made this genre of game before. I am more comfortable with making 2D platformer so it was an eye opening experience to see the amount of effort required to create a game in this genre.</p>
		<p>Since I was the director for this game, I had to distribute the work properly as well as setting up ways to make sure everyone's work is inside the final game. For this project, I used GitHub to make it easier to merge the Unity project throughout the two days time limit. Unfortunately, my friend who helped me with coding the project is not that experienced with Unity so I had to code almost all of the game's mechanics. Here's the list of mechanics that I implemented in the game:</p>

			<dt> <strong>Customization</strong> </dt>
			<dd> Inside the game, we wanted the player to be able to create customizable dice. Not only that, we wanted the dice that the player made to show up so that the player know what kind of dice they made. I figured out a system that allows the game to uniquely identify which dice in particular that the player made based on their selection. To give an example, our game allows the player to choose the material and colour of the dice. If the player chose the colour "yellow" and the material "metal", the game would display a yellow metal dice. I did this by sorting the array of dice objects in a way that I can simply add integers based on the colour and material the player chose to uniquely identify which dice in the array the player made. For example, for a "yellow metal" dice I simply add 3 for "yellow" and 4 for "metal" to get the "yellow metal" dice which can be accessed with dice[7] (the array that hold all dice objects).</dd>
